They sell Sinless Certifications at the Redemption Land ^[ Splash-O-Baptise(tm) ]

# I found the seller
Stanislas (honest merchant) will sell you a Sinless Certificate. Ask him about it. ^[ You have to talk to the bouncers, first. ]

# Expensive
9,999 pounds! Where can you find that kind of money?

# Yeah, where?
Have you checked around? ^[ There is a help wanted sign in the Town. ]

# I found something
Lady Dark Dark would pay you Â£9,999 for getting rid of the rats. What a happy coincidence! ^[ Talk to her about everything. ]

# Pan flute?
Yup, you got it. [Build a pan flute.](pan_flute/index.md)

# I have the pan flute
Great, give it to that French Mime ^[ You have to talk to the mime about panflutes at least twice. Before that you have to talk to Lady Dark Dark about the panflute. ]. You now have enough money for the certificate.
