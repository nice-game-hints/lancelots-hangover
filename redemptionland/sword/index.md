title: Get St. Anselm's sword
---

To fight like a saint you need the sword of St. Anselm.

# Where is it?
Well, this is easy. It is at Splash-O-Baptise. Just pull it out of the stone.

# It's not that...
Okay. Well, it is in the Broceliande Forest. Maybe you should try to find it.

# I'm getting lost
Ask the locals. The monk will give you good hints.

# So?
 - He told about the weird shepherd at the Typical Village.
 - He also said something about the [Gay Bar](../gay_bar.md)

# I visited those places
So, you need to get some drugs to have visions in the forest.
 - [Get some cannabis](cannabis.md) from the stoned shepherd.
 - Get some "drug" from the Gay Bar. ^[ Take some of the Fem&M's from the table. ]

# I have drugs!
Try to use them on Lancelot. They don't have virtually any effect!

# Umm.. okay
Well, they affect a little. But could they help you navigate the forest?

# Could they?
Try it out. Go to the first screen (after the monk screen) and take some.

# Whoa!
You see the path.

# But it ends abruptly
Time for some mixed usage! ^[ While standing on the pool take the other drug. ]

# I need a third one!
Oh, right... Where would you get the third drug?

# Any hints?
Have you noticed that you can go right in the first screen of the village.

# Yes, I have
Then you must have talked to the Witch.

# Yes, I did
So, she said the last drug is called ["Smurfette drug"](smurfette_drug.md).

# I have the smurfette drug
First, use cannabis/Fem&Ms and use the Smurfette drug as the last one. You will find the sword.
