The angry mob is burning the Witch. She will help you if you get rid of the mob.

# How?
Did you try to listen to them? ^[ Talk to them. ]
You have to listen to the crowd. The morons won't leave unless you listen their endless chit-chat for hours.

# Any hints?
Lancelot gave them already:
"HONEY catches more flies than vinegar. But only DEAF people could support this torture."

# Any more hints?
[Honey...](../honey.md)

# I got something else
Beeswax. Try it on Lancelot.

# That was pretty fun!
Yeah, not hearing anything. It is fun.

# I got it!
Put some beeswax into your ears near the angry mob.
