---

To get back to England you need a compass. Look around the places for items.

# How to build a compass?
Old compasses were magnetized needles floating in water.

# Okay?
So, you need:
 - [A compass needle](needle.md)
 - Bucket full of water ^[ There's a bucket at the Pillory. Fill it with water from the fountain. ]

# I have it
Take it to the Belgians.
