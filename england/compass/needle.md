You would need a magnetic compass needle.

# Where to?
Have you eaten for a while?

# No?
Go visit the Gay Bar, they should have some food.

# The olives?
They will do. Eat them by using them on Lancelot.

# A toothpick!
A _metallic_ toothpick.

# But not magnetic.
No, you need to electrify it.

# Where?
Go to the alchemist lab and use it in the weirder machine to make it magnetic.
