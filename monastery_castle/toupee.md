In [the Drunk Monk's First Aid room](enter_drunk_monk.md) there is a drunk monk (surprise!) with a toupee.

# I want the toupee!
You have some use for it?

# I don't know, I want it!
Okay okay... Take it.

# It won't
It is hair. Hair is usually also _waxed_ away.

# Waxed?
Yeah, put some wax into it and take it.

# Wax?
You know what are made of wax?

# What?
Candles! There is a castle on the tabernacle at the Prayers Factory. ^[ Take the candle and use it on the monk's toupee. ]
