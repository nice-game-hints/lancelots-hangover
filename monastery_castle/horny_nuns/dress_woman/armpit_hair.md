title: Armpit hair
---

To fool the nuns that you are a proper lady you would need some hair in your armpits.

# Hair?
You know, hair.

# Where do I get hair?
What else is hairy than hairy armpits?

# What?
Hairy head!

# But the monks!
They are bald. Except one. ^[ There's a monk with a toupee at [Drunk Monks' First Aid room](../../enter_drunk_monk.md) ]

# I found him
[Get his toupee.](../../toupee.md)

# I have it
Then you can go and talk to the nuns [dressed up as woman](index.md).
