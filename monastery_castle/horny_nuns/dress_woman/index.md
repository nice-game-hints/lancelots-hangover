order: 50

To fool the nuns you have to dress up like a woman.

# How to?
Well, everybody else here are naked, e.g. showing their breasts.

# Okay?
But you don't have breasts, don't you?

# I did, though
When you were under the influence of drugs. That's right!

# But I don't have drugs...
You have the holiest drug of them all.

# You mean?
The Mass Wine! ^[ It is on the table at [Drunk Monks' First Aid room](../../enter_drunk_monk.md). ]

# Not fooled, yet
You would need some [hair in your armpits](armpit_hair.md), like a proper lady.
