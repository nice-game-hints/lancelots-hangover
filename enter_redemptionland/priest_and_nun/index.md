title: Get rid of the catholic priest and the nun
order: 20
---

Talk to the nun and the priest. The nun _really_ likes the sound of the priest. They could have some good time...

# What to do?
Have you read your brochure, yet? ^[ Just click it in the inventory. ]

# I did!
It is an organic food ad. The nun really would like to hear about it.

# From Lancelot?
No! From the priest. Let the priest read it to her.

# How?
Put the ad inside [his bible](../bible.md)?

# I got the bible!
[Attach the ad into it.](attach_page.md)

# There it is
Give the bible back to the priest.
