You have the bible? It would be cool to modify it with the organic food ad. ^[ You get the organic food ad by reading the brochure. ]

# How to attach it?
Combine it in the inventory.

# It slips away...
Hmm... you would need to make it more _sticky_.

# Sticky?
Some sticky hands would make it sticky.

# Sticky hands?
Give the ad to the dirty peasant orphans. It is now sticky. ^[ Attach it to the bible. ]
