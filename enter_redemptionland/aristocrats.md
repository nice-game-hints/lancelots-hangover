order: 10
---

The aristocrats will only listen to an employee.

# But I am on a holy quest!
But you are not an employee!

# Fine! How do I fool them?
There's that Hug-A-Leper(tm) far right. He is an employee.

# Right!
He will do the gig, but he won't say anything about the bed size!

# Do I have to do everything myself?
Well, actually, yes.

# You mean?
Get [the big head from him](big_head.md). ^[ Put it into your head. ]

# I am an employee!
With the big head on your head go and talk to the aristocrats.
