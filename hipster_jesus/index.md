You are again mixing a drink into the Holy Grail.

# What drink?
_The authentic devotion yields only to contrary minds._

# What is this?
Do the _contrary_ drink.

# Contrary?
Or reverse.

# Reverse?
Mix the Saint Crappist of Chimay but in reverse order.

# Tell me
 1. Pour blue alcohol into the grail
 2. Pour red alcohol into the grail
 3. Pour yellow alcohol into the grail ^[ You have to mix green and red alcohol in the mixer to get yellow. ]
 4. Pour some green alcohol into the grail
